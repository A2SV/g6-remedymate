## 🌿 RemedyMate: AI-Powered Home Remedy Advisor for Africa
RemedyMate is a simple mobile/web application designed to bridge the gap between minor health symptoms and professional healthcare in Africa, with a primary focus on Ethiopia. It acts as a smart pharmacist buddy using Generative AI to provide safe, simple, and culturally relevant self-care guidance.

### 🌍 The Problem
Access to quick and affordable healthcare is limited in many parts of Africa, including Ethiopia, due to few doctors, high costs, and distant clinics. As a result, about 80% of people rely on traditional and natural remedies. However, this often leads to confusion on when symptoms are mild versus serious, potentially causing delayed care or misuse of remedies.

### ✨ Our Solution
RemedyMate provides a safety-first, natural-first approach to managing minor ailments.
- **Symptom Chat Input**: Users describe their issues via text or voice in a natural conversation.
- **Priority on Natural Remedies**: The AI first suggests home fixes like ginger tea, honey, rest, or local superfoods like moringa leaves.
- **Over-the-Counter (OTC) Guidance**: If natural remedies aren't enough, it suggests safe, non-prescription OTC categories like antacids or paracetamol.
- **Smart Severity Check & Triage**: The app detects "red flags" and strongly urges users to see a doctor immediately for serious symptoms (e.g., chest pain), always including a disclaimer.
- **Local & Bilingual**: It supports Amharic and English and includes culturally relevant tips, like using Ethiopian spices.
- **Low-Bandwidth Friendly**: It works with a text-first interface and offers an offline mode for spotty connections.

### 🎯 Target Audience
Everyday Africans aged 18-45 facing minor health issues. There is a big focus on Ethiopians who often use traditional remedies and anyone wanting natural-first advice without waiting for a clinic.

### 🚀 Our Mission
To empower people in Africa, especially in rural Ethiopia, to manage minor health symptoms safely at home with trusted self-care guidance and clear alerts, while always encouraging professional care when needed.
